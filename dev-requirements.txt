# Pip requirements file for development dependencies.

# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process.

# Make sure that the package versions in minimum-constraints.txt are also
# the minimum versions required in requirements.txt and dev-requirements.txt.

# Direct dependencies:
# -r requirements.txt

# Unit test (imports into testcases):
#testfixtures>=4.3.3

# Coverage reporting (no imports, invoked via coveralls script, only used on py27):
# Note: python-coveralls 2.9.1 has requirement coverage==4.0.3, and therefore
# must be stated before pytest-cov, whose 2.5.1 specifies requirement
# coverage>=3.7.1 and thus would get coverage 4.5 1 if processed first.
python-coveralls>=2.8.0; python_version == '2.7'

# Unit test (no imports, invoked via py.test script)
pytest>=3.3.0

# TODO:the <2.6 limitation is a temporary bypass because of import conflicts.
# Remove when the conflicts are corrected. ks 14 Sept. 2018
pytest-cov>=2.4.0,<2.6

# Sphinx (no imports, invoked via sphinx-build script):
# Keep in sync with rtd-requirements.txt
Sphinx>=1.7.6,<2.0.0; python_version < '3.5'  # BSD
Sphinx>=1.7.6,<2.0.0; python_version >= '3.5'  # BSD
# TODO: On Python 3.5 and higher, Sphinx currently fails, see issue
#       https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/6246. Therefore, Sphinx has
#       been pinned to below 2.0.0 also for those Python versions.
sphinx-git>=10.1.1
GitPython>=2.1.1
sphinxcontrib-fulltoc>=1.2.0

# PyLint:
pylint>=1.6.4; python_version == '2.7'

# Twine: Needed for uploading to Pypi (no imports, invoked via twine script)
twine>=1.8.1

# Jupyter Notebook (no imports, invoked via jupyter script)
jupyter>=1.0.0
# notebook>=4.3.1  # XXX: Check if used

# The tornado package is used by ipykernel which is used by jupyter.
# Tornado 5.0.0 and 5.0.1 rejects installation if the Python ssl module
# does not have certain symbols required by Tornado. This issue exists for
# example with Python 2.7.6 on Ubuntu 14.04, but not with Python 2.7.5 on
# RHEL 7.4. This can be checked with:
#   python -c "import ssl; ssl.SSLContext; ssl.create_default_context; ssl.match_hostname"
# Other projects have the same issue:
#   https://github.com/floydhub/dl-docker/issues/84
# The following is a circumvention of this issue that nails the tornado
# version to below 5.0 on Python 2.
# TODO: Follow up on resolution of this issue.
tornado<5.0; python_version <= '2.7'

# temporary fix to get around problem introduced by pyzmq 16.03 release 30
# Oct 2017.  See issue #80
# TODO: retest this in the future so we can remove this limitation
pyzmq==16.0.2
