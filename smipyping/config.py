"""
The :mod:`smipyping.config` module sets configuration variables for smipyping.

These configuration variables are used bysmipyping only after its modules
have been loaded, so they can be modified by the user directly after
importing :mod:`smipyping`. For example:

::

    import smipyping
    pywbem.config.ENFORCE_INTEGER_RANGE = False

Note that the source file of the :mod:`pywbem.config` module should not be
changed by the user. Instead, use the technique described above to modify
the variables.
"""

# This module is meant to be safe for 'import *'.

__all__ = ['ENFORCE_INTEGER_RANGE']

#: Enforce the value range in CIM integer types (e.g. :class:`~pywbem.Uint8`).
#:
#: * True (default): Enforce the value range; Assigning values out of range
#:   causes :exc:`~py:exceptions.ValueError` to be raised.
#: * False: Do not enforce the value range; Assigning values out of range
#:   works.
ENFORCE_INTEGER_RANGE = True
