    """
    Invoke the 'smicli' command as a child process.

    This requires that the 'smicli' command is installed in the current
    Python environment.

    Parameters:

      args (iterable of :term:`string`): Command line arguments, without the
        command name.
        Each single argument must be its own item in the iterable; combining
        the arguments into a string does not work.
        The arguments may be binary strings encoded in UTF-8, or unicode
        strings.

      env (dict): Environment variables to be put into the environment when
        calling the command. May be `None`. Dict key is the variable name as a
        :term:`string`; dict value is the variable value as a :term:`string`
        (without any shell escaping needed).

    Returns:

      tuple(rc, stdout, stderr): Output of the command, where:

        * rc(int): Exit code of the command.
        * stdout(:term:`unicode string`): Standard output of the command,
          as a unicode string with newlines represented as '\\n'.
          An empty string, if there was no data.
        * stderr(:term:`unicode string`): Standard error of the command,
          as a unicode string with newlines represented as '\\n'.
          An empty string, if there was no data.
