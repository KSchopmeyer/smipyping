usage: serversweep [options] subnet [subnet] ...

Sweep possible WBEMServer ports across a range of IP subnets and ports to find existing running WBEM servers.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Positional arguments:
  subnet                IP subnets to scan (ex. 10.1.132). Multiple subnets
                         allowed. Each subnet string is itself a definition that
                        consists of period separated octets that are used to
                        create the individual ip addresses to be tested:
                          * Integers: Each integer is in the range 0-255
                              ex. 10.1.2.9
                          * Octet range definition: A range expansion is in the
                             form: int-int which defines the mininum and maximum
                              values for that octet (ex 10.1.132-134) or
                          * Integer lists: A range list is in the form:
                             int,int,int
                             and defines the set of values for that octet.
                        Missing octet definitions are expanded to the value
                        range defined by the min and max octet value parameters
                        All octets of the ip address can use any of the 3
                        definitions.
                        Examples: 10.1.132,134 expands to addresses in 10.1.132
                        and 10.1.134. where the last octet is the range 1 to 254

Scan related options:
  Specify parameters of the subnet scan

  --min_octet_val [Min], -s [Min]
                        Minimum expanded value for any octet that is not
                        specifically included in a net definition. Default = 1
  --max_octet_val [Max], -e [Max]
                        Minimum expanded value for any octet that is not
                        specifically included in a net definition. Default =
                        254
  --port [PORT [PORT ...]], -p [PORT [PORT ...]]
                        Port(s) to test. This argument may be define multiple
                        ports. Ex. -p 5988 5989. Default=5989

General options:
  --config_file CONFIG_FILE, -c CONFIG_FILE
                        Use config file to determine if server is in database
  -D DBTYPE, --dbtype DBTYPE
                        DBTYPE to use. Default=csv
  --no_threads          If set, uses non-threaded implementation for pings.
                        The non-threaded implementation takes MUCH longer to
                        execute butis provided in case threading causes issues
                        in a particular user environment.
  --verbose, -v         If set output detail displays as test proceeds
  --dryrun              Display list of systems/ports to be scanned but do not
                        scan. This is a diagnostic tool

Examples:
  serversweep 10.1.132-134
        The above example will scan the subnets 10.1.134, 10.1.133, and
        10.1.134 from 1 to 254 for the 4 the octet of ip addresses. This
        is explicitly defined by 10.1.132:124.1:254
  serversweep 10.1.134
        Scan a complete Class C subnet, 10.1.134 for the default port (5989)
  serversweep 10.1.132,134 -p 5989 5988
        Scan 10.1.132.1:254 and 10.1.134.1:254 for ports 5988 and 5989
