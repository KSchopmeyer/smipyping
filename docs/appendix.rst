.. _'Special type names`:

Special type names
------------------

This documentation uses a few special terms to refer to Python types:

.. glossary::

   string
      a :term:`unicode string` or a :term:`byte string`

   unicode string
      a Unicode string type (:func:`unicode <py2:unicode>` in
      Python 2, and :class:`py3:str` in Python 3)

   byte string
      a byte string type (:class:`py2:str` in Python 2, and
      :class:`py3:bytes` in Python 3). Unless otherwise
      indicated, byte strings in pywbem are always UTF-8 encoded.

   number
      one of the number types :class:`py:int`, :class:`py2:long` (Python 2
      only), or :class:`py:float`.

   integer
      one of the integer types :class:`py:int` or :class:`py2:long` (Python 2
      only).

   callable
      a type for callable objects (e.g. a function, calling a class returns a
      new instance, instances are callable if they have a
      :meth:`~py:object.__call__` method).

   DeprecationWarning
      a standard Python warning that indicates a deprecated functionality.
      See section :ref:`Deprecation policy` and the standard Python module
      :mod:`py:warnings` for details.

   Element
      class ``xml.dom.minidom.Element``. Its methods are described in section
      :ref:`py:dom-element-objects` of module :mod:`py:xml.dom`, with
      minidom specifics described in section :ref:`py:minidom-objects` of
      module :mod:`py:xml.dom.minidom`.

   CIM data type
      one of the types listed in :ref:`CIM data types`.

   CIM object
      one of the types listed in :ref:`CIM objects`.


.. _`Troubleshooting`:

Troubleshooting
---------------

Here are some trouble shooting hints for the installation of pywbem.

AttributeError for NullHandler during mkvirtualenv on Python 2.6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the `mkvirtualenv` command fails on Python 2.6 with this error::

    File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/stevedore/__init__.py", line 23,
      in <module> LOG.addHandler(logging.NullHandler())
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'NullHandler'

then the `stevedore` PyPI package is too recent(!) The owners of that
package spent effort to remove the previously existing Python 2.6 support in
some steps, starting with stevedore v1.10.

The solution is to use stevedore v1.9. Note that for virtualenvwrapper to use
it, it must be installed into the system Python:

    $ sudo pip install stevedore==1.9

TypeError about StreamHandler argument 'stream' during mkvirtualenv on Python 2.6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the `mkvirtualenv` command fails on Python 2.6 with this error::

    File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/virtualenvwrapper/hook_loader.py",
      line 101, in main
    console = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stderr)
    TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'stream'

then the `virtualenvwrapper` PyPI package is too old. As of its released
version v4.7.1, a fix for that is in the master branch of its repository and
has not been released yet.

While a new version of `virtualenvwrapper` with the fix is not yet released,
a solution is to clone the `virtualenvwrapper` repository and to install it
from its working directory. Note that it must be installed into the system
Python::

    $ git clone https://bitbucket.org/dhellmann/virtualenvwrapper.git virtualenvwrapper
    $ cd virtualenvwrapper
    $ sudo python setup.py install

Swig error 'Unrecognized option -builtin' during M2Crypto install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Python 2.x, pywbem uses the `M2Crypto` package from PyPI and installs it
during its own installation. The M2Crypto package invokes the Swig tool during
its installation. If the version of Swig is too old, the invocation of Swig
fails with::

    swig error : Unrecognized option -builtin

The solution is to use Swig v2.0 or higher.

The pywbem setup script checks the version of Swig and installs a newer version
of Swig, or if not available builds Swig from its sources (while automatically
installing any further OS-level prerequisites needed for building Swig).

gcc does not find Python.h while installing M2Crypto
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Python 2.x, pywbem uses the `M2Crypto` package from PyPI and installs it
during its own installation. The M2Crypto package invokes the Swig tool during
its installation. Swig invokes the gcc compiler on source code it produces.
That source code needs the Python.h header file.

If the invocation of gcc fails with::

    SWIG/_m2crypto_wrap.c:127:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory

then you do not have the Python.h header file available.

The installation of pywbem with OS-level prereqs (see :ref:`Installation`)
installs the necessary Python SDK package for C/C++ (or displays its package
name). On RHEL, the missing package is `python-dev`.
